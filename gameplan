Server
- Upload form w/ progress bar
- Converts all file formats to raw waveforms to stream to G
- Generates LED data to stream to G

- caches data and forms a queue
- play queue for when to stream

Galileo needed? Not sure if it can act fully as a server (only 32gb micro sd probably slow). Will do the server part first.
